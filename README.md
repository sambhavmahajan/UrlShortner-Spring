### UrlShortner
This is a project to shorten URL's using generating a random UUID and getting the first 5 characters as the shortned url. Before starting, please edit the .env file for your database.

Keyfeatures:
- Shortens Provided URL
- Expires the URL after 1 day(feature in progress)
- Caches the shortended URLs.

Currently the project does not have good UI (although i would not say i am good at creating it), i might implement one. you might see another similar project, [this one](https://github.com/sambhavmahajan/urlshortner) written in golang, this one's more advanced, was just practicing spring boot hence thought about creating this project.

Thanks!
